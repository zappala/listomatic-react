# list-o-matic React front-end

A simple list application to demonstrate web development
concepts. This version uses React for the front end.

Currently, supported back ends are:

* [List-o-matic Flask Server](https://github.com/zappala/listomatic-flask-server)
* [List-o-matic Node and Mongo Server](https://github.com/zappala/listomatic-node-mongo)
* [List-o-matic Node and MySQL Server](https://github.com/zappala/listomatic-node-server)

## Installation

First, setup the server. Then, copy the public directory to `static`
in the top level directory of the Flask server or to `public` for the
node servers. Run the server and visit the site in a browser.
