# list-o-matic React front-end

A simple list application to demonstrate web development
concepts. This version uses React for the front end.

Currently, the only supported back end is the [List-o-matic Flask Server](https://github.com/zappala/listomatic-flask-server).

## Installation

First, setup the Flask server. Then, copy the public directory to `static` in
the top level directory of the Flask server. Run the flask server and
visit localhost:5000/.
